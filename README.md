### -termplay- a console music player.
### Accepts all the mpv player default keybindings

### TODO

- Create tabs and display all the content(Handle huge music libraries).
- ~Handle the current playing file properly and take inputs.~
- Use [mpvlib](https://github.com/jaseg/python-mpv) instead of mpv binary.(Now termplay is just an ugly hack).


### Contributions are welcome.
